CBP has previously established the CBP Tactical Communication (TACCOM) 
Modernization Project to meet these critical modernization needs.  Through the 
TACCOM Modernization Project Office, CBP has already performed modernization in 
some geographic areas.  In the process of performing modernization tasks, the CBP 
TACCOM Project Office has established the following processes and baselines: 
 

 A project governance structure is in place, consisting of Government and 
contractor staff that provides guidance, direction, facilitation and oversight of 
TACCOM projects and tasks. 

 A TACCOM technology baseline is in place that identifies an overall technical 
solution.  This technology baseline is being implemented in some areas. 

 A baseline schedule and work breakdown structure (WBS) has been established, 
identifying the timeline, work and major milestones necessary to complete a 
modernization project.  This baseline schedule and WBS are in use in some 
areas. 

 A TACCOM modernization process has been developed that aligns with the CBP 
System Life Cycle (SLC).  This process is in use for ongoing modernization 
efforts.

4.3.4.4 COVERAGE TEST METHODOLOGY  
 
One repeater at each transmit site will be tested for correlation with predicted 
coverage contours. Updated coverage maps, based on installed sites at the time 
of testing will determine the areas that will be tested for coverage. It is anticipated 
that each area of responsibility (AOR) will require three days of drive testing.   
 
The contractor shall generate reports detailing the test results for each transmit 
site. These reports shall include signed documentation (by both The Contractor 
and the COTR-designated CBP Houlton representative) indicating the test was 
performed in accordance with the CTP. The results of the test indicate the 
acceptance or non-acceptance of the coverage portion of the system. The CTP 
results are not associated with the Acceptance Test Plan. They are provided to 
verify proper site operation and to identify requirements for coverage 
improvement in future phases.

APPENDIX B P25 INTER-RF SUBSYSTEM INTERFACE (ISSI) GUIDANCE 
 
When procuring equipment for communications systems development and expansion, a 
standards-based approach should be used to begin migration to multi-jurisdictional and 
multi-disciplinary interoperability.  Specifically, all new voice systems should be 
compatible with the Project 25 (P25) suite of standards.  This recommendation is 
intended for government-owned or leased land mobile public safety radio equipment, 
and its purpose is to make sure that such equipment or systems are capable of 
interoperating with other public safety land mobile equipment or systems. It is not 
intended to apply to commercial services that offer other types of interoperability 
solutions and does not exclude any application if it demonstrates that the system or 
equipment being proposed will lead to enhanced interoperability.  P25 has also been 
endorsed by the U.S. Department of Defense for Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems.  
 
The government programs requiring P25 acquisition through federal grants must have 
confidence that the equipment required operates to the standards.  The Inter-RF 
Subsystem Interface (ISSI) permits users in one subsystem to communicate with users 
in a different system, from one jurisdiction to another, from one agency to another, from 
one city to another, etc.  One or more TIA-published documents are identified in each 
category of Overview, Protocol, Conformance Test Procedures, Performance 
Measurements Methods, Performance Recommendations, and Interoperability Test 
Procedures.  The following lists current P25 Inter-RF Subsystem Interface (ISSI) 
description, specification, and assessment documents to be used as guidance in the 
development of interoperable LMR systems. 
 

 Project 25 Inter-RF Subsystem Interface Overview, TSB-102.BACC-A (Dec 
2003) (ISSI Requirements and Standards Considerations) 

 Project 25 Inter-RF Subsystem Interface Messages and Procedures for Voice 
Service, TIA-102.BACA-A (Apr 2007) (Architecture and Protocol Suite Overview, 
SIP Messages and Parameters Definition, RTP Message Vocabulary, Mobility 
Management, Call Control, and Push-to-Talk Management) 

 Project 25 Inter-RF Subsystem Interface Measurement Methods for Voice 
Services, TIA-102.CACA (Apr 2007) 

 Project 25 Inter-RF Subsystem Interface Performance Recommendations for 
Voice Services, TIA-102.CACB (Apr 2007)
